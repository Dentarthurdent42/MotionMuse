# BioSignal → Sound

A browser-based instrument that maps live webcam data — hand position, gesture, and body pose — to audio synthesis parameters in real time. No plugins, no install: pure Web APIs served as static files.

## Demo

![BioSignal → Sound screenshot](docs/screenshot.png)

Open `index.html` (or the Netlify deploy) and:
1. Click **START CAMERA** — MediaPipe loads and begins detecting hands and pose
2. Click **AUDIO ON** — the Web Audio synthesiser starts
3. Click **PRESET** — a default mapping is applied; move your hands to play

## How it works

```
Webcam → MediaPipe (Hand + Pose) → Signal Bus → Mapper → Web Audio Engine
```

- **Signal Bus** (`src/bus.js`): a central `Map` of named signals (e.g. `hand_L_y`, `pinch_R`, `elbow_L`). Any source can `register` and `update` signals; any consumer can `norm`-alise them to 0–1.
- **CV Source** (`src/cv.js`): runs MediaPipe `HandLandmarker` and `PoseLandmarker` on every video frame, extracts ~30 signals per frame, and writes them into the bus.
- **Mapper** (`src/mapper.js`): each mapping row takes one signal, applies a curve (linear, quad, cubic, log, sqrt, invert), scales it to an output range, and writes it to an audio parameter on every RAF tick.
- **Audio Engine** (`src/engine.js`): two oscillators through a BiquadFilter and a convolution reverb, all driven by the Web Audio API with 25 ms parameter smoothing.

## Available signals

| Key | Description |
|-----|-------------|
| `hand_L_x` / `hand_R_x` | Wrist X position (0 = left edge) |
| `hand_L_y` / `hand_R_y` | Wrist Y position (0 = bottom, 1 = top) |
| `hand_L_open` / `hand_R_open` | Hand openness (0 = fist, 1 = fully open) |
| `hand_L_spread` / `hand_R_spread` | Thumb-to-pinky spread |
| `pinch_L` / `pinch_R` | Thumb-to-index world-space distance (camera-independent) |
| `finger_L_thumb` … `finger_R_pinky` | Individual finger extension (0–1) |
| `elbow_L` / `elbow_R` | Elbow joint angle in degrees (0–180) |
| `shoulder_y_L` / `shoulder_y_R` | Shoulder height |
| `shoulder_width` | Distance between shoulders |
| `arm_raise_L` / `arm_raise_R` | Arm raise (0 = down, 1 = fully raised) |
| `torso_tilt` | Lateral torso lean (−1 = left, +1 = right) |
| `head_x` / `head_y` | Nose position |
| `nose_y` | Raw nose Y (high = head dipped) |
| `hand_L_z` / `hand_R_z` | Hand **distance from camera** (0 = far, 1 = near) |
| `hand_dz` | Depth difference between hands (push one hand forward) |
| `body_z` | Torso distance from camera |
| `depth_near` | Nearest surface in the scene, in metres (LiDAR only) |
| `depth_center` | Depth at frame centre, in metres (LiDAR only) |

## Optical depth inputs (LiDAR / ToF)

Out of the box, depth-from-camera is estimated monocularly from MediaPipe
landmarks — apparent hand size and shoulder span. It needs no extra hardware
and works with any webcam, but it is relative and scale-ambiguous.

For **true metric depth**, the `◈ LiDAR` toggle (top-right of the camera view)
opts into the [WebXR Depth Sensing API](https://immersive-web.github.io/depth-sensing/),
which exposes the per-pixel depth map produced by an optical depth sensor —
Apple's **LiDAR** on iOS AR-capable devices, or **ToF** cameras on ARCore
Android. When active, per-landmark depth is sampled directly from the depth map
and transparently replaces the monocular estimate behind the same `*_z` signal
keys, so existing mappings keep working — just more accurately, including in
low-texture and low-light scenes. Two extra metric signals (`depth_near`,
`depth_center`, in metres) are also published.

The toggle is feature-detected: it dims when `immersive-ar` + `depth-sensing`
is unavailable (e.g. desktop browsers, iOS Safari without WebXR), and the app
silently falls back to the monocular estimate. The pluggable backend lives in
`src/depth.js` — additional optical sources (stereo, depth webcams via a
`getUserMedia` depth track) can be added there behind the same signal keys.

## Adding a new signal source

1. In your source module, call `bus.register(key, { label, group, min, max, source })` for each signal in `init()`.
2. Call `bus.update(key, value)` each sample.
3. Call `bus.decay(key)` when the source is absent to fade signals smoothly to zero.

## Running locally

No build step required. Serve the repo root over HTTP (ES modules require a server, not `file://`):

```bash
npx serve .
# or
python3 -m http.server 8080
```

Then open `http://localhost:8080`.

## UI/UX tests

The test suite takes Playwright screenshots across four viewports and evaluates them with Claude Vision:

```bash
npm install
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-… npm run test:ui
# open test-results/ui-ux-report.html
```

Without `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` the screenshots are still saved but LLM evaluation is skipped (CI exits 0).

## Browser requirements

- Chromium 90+, Firefox 90+, Safari 15.4+ (WebGL required for MediaPipe GPU delegate)
- Camera permission required
- HTTPS or `localhost` required (getUserMedia restriction)
